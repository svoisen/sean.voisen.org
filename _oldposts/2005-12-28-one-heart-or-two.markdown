title: One heart or two

> “The best way to predict the future is to create it.” — Peter Drucker

Near Oraibi, on the Hopi Indian Reservation in Arizona, there is a petroglyph that the Hopi people etched into a sandstone cliff many, many years ago. The petroglyph on this cliff, commonly known as Prophecy Rock, depicts a crossroads of the two paths of life that humanity can take as it progresses into the future. One path, the path of the “two-hearted people,” the path of those who think only with their heads, is a path of chaos and destruction. It is the path of separation from and domination over nature. It is the path of environmental degradation, war, and isolation. The other path, the path of the “one-hearted people,” the path of those whose heads are united with their hearts in making choices, leads to joy and sustainability. It is the path of wholeness and working with nature. It is the path of environmental preservation, peace, and collaborative, sustainable living.

I believe that this is the decade in which humanity has found itself at the crossroads of the “one-hearted” and “two-hearted” paths. This decade, however, is now more than halfway over. Soon we, as a species, for better or for worse, will have made our choice. Destruction or sustainability. Chaos or peace. The question is, in the next year, what are you going to do to ensure that our collective choice is the better choice? What actions and decisions, small or large, are you going to take over the next 365 days to ensure that we walk with one heart instead of two?
