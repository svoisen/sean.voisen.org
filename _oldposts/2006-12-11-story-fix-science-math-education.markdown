title: Can story fix science and math education?
---

Context matters. Story matters.

There is a reason why so many young American students scratch and claw their way through science and mathematics classes, doing their best just to try and make it, let alone understand what they’re studying or being tested on. There is a reason why the United States continues to slowly fall behind in math and science education. And it’s not necessarily because so many of our students are dumb or just plain bad at logical, critical thinking. I think it’s because many of them attend schools where they are taught science and math without any historical context. They are given formulas and concepts and theories without being told the stories behind the men and women who devised these same formulas, concepts and theories. And without context, formulas, concepts and theories have no meaning. And without meaning, they are far more difficult for the mind to retain.

I may have been an engineering major in college, but truth be told, I’m far more interested in math and science now than I ever was all throughout my academic career. I also understand it better. And the reason is not simply that I’ve had three years of not studying it to allow it to slowly settle and coalesce in my mind (though that may indeed be a possibility). The reason is that I’ve finally had the opportunity to discover and read some fascinating books on the history of math and science — books that presented the same subjects and same formulas I learned in school, but within the context of a story. Obviously, these books were not textbooks. But what I learned by reading them is that all those obscure equations and concepts I had once learned but had long since stashed away in the far recesses of my mind — things like Boyle’s Law and Euler’s Identity and L’Hopital’s Rule — actually had a story behind them. Imagine that.

It should come as no surprise that humans remember things far better when they are placed in some sort of narrative context — when they are given meaning through a string of facts and events and emotions. We also become far more interested in subjects when they are presented this way. Even the most mundane information can be made interesting when packaged within a well-told story. But in school we aren’t given stories. We are given mostly facts and equations and figures and methodologies and are told to do our best to memorize them. Teachers will tell students how and why something works, but rarely will they present the equally as important where — where did all of these things come from? Who were the people who spent their lives trying to solve these problems and why did they bother? It’s an important missing piece of learning in the educational puzzle.

In his blog, [ionfish](http://www.ionfish.co.uk/), Benedict Eastaugh [writes with similar conviction](http://ionfish.co.uk/2006/12/tying-down-facts/):

> The history of understanding also gives us a sense of our own place in the world. Without it, all we have is huge lists of observations and arguments, an intellectual burden we cannot absorb, crushing us beneath its bulk.

Indeed. There are a multitude of great authors out there today who have a knack for taking science and math and making it interesting through understandable narrative: [Carl Zimmer](http://www.carlzimmer.com/), [Charles Seife](http://www.users.cloud9.net/~cgseife/), [Brian Greene](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/physics/fac-bios/Greene/faculty.html), Natalie Angier and even the travel writer [Bill Bryson](http://www.randomhouse.com/features/billbryson/bb_title/display.pperl?isbn=9780767908184), just to name a few. These people are doing important work, but it’s not enough. It’s not enough for a rare few people like me to discover these stories long after our formal education has come to a close. We need to tell these stories to our kids, using pictures and terms that they can understand. That’s the only way we’re going to continue to inspire more future scientists and engineers — people we desperately need to help make this world a better place.
