The Dalai Lama isn’t as famous as I thought, but he sure can draw a crowd. Yesterday, for instance, I saw him speak at a packed stadium in Tucson, Arizona that felt far more like a giant, over-air-conditioned meat locker than a speaking venue. Nevertheless, His Holiness (or H.H. if you’re into the whole brevity thing) was as jovial as ever.

My dad once told me that a friend of his had to explain to his wife who the Dalai Lama was. A native of Lebanon, she had never heard of him before. After a few minutes of confusing explanations, he finally got her to understand what the man was all about when he said that, “he’s kind of like the Pope of the Buddhists.” It’s a crude likening, especially considering that Buddhists don’t have any one primary prophetic lineage and, since they don’t believe in a creator per se, are basically non-theistic. Still, the example works if only because H.H. is the all-star figurehead of the Buddhist world for the West just like the Pope is the all-star figurehead of the Christians.

Unfortunately, though, labels like this always bring trouble. They attempt to take the entire essence of a person and distill it into a single word — something that inevitably never works. It leads to all sorts of misunderstanding. Case in point:

Yesterday, a couple of men stood outside the Tucson Convention Center carrying signs in protest of the Dalai Lama’s appearance there. I’m guessing they were Christian Evangelicals of some sort because, though I can’t remember the exact wording, the signs warned of the importance of having faith in the Lord Jesus Christ lest ye be damned to hell. I’m all for freedom of speech and protest and the right to opinion, so I had no problem with these people. Nevertheless, what concerns me is ignorance, and this misdirected protest was a one of the most blatant displays of ignorance I’ve ever seen.

Why? If you know anything about H.H. the Dalai Lama one of the first things you’ll know is that he’s not trying to convert anyone. In fact, he consistently tells people <em>not to become Buddhist</em>, but instead to embrace their own faith and their own culture. He wants Christians to stay Christian. He wants Muslims to stay Muslim. He wants Hindus to stay Hindu. He’s a crusader for peaceful diversity and inter-faith dialogue. Many people, many different ways.

During his talk, H.H. told a story of how he was invited by a group of Christian monks to give a lecture on the four gospels. Not really knowing anything about the gospels, all he could do was read them once over and then try his best. What’s interesting is that, though his Tibetan Buddhist view of the universe says nothing about God as a creator, when he spoke with these monks he refused to bring question to their faith in God by pointing this out. Instead, he delivered a talk directly in-line with their views that only reaffirmed their faith in the Lord, and often, the monks said, with interesting insight. He didn’t, as he said, “want to bring confusion to their minds.”

If only more religious leaders would remain as open as this man, we might have less division and more far more unity. If only those men outside the convention center had realized what they were really protesting they might have done otherwise. Protest has its purpose, but all this againstness just perpetuates ignorance and separation.

Do not protest blindly. Do not be against something just to be against it. Don’t remain ignorant of something just because it’s different than your worldview — worldviews are just worldviews and in the end they don’t hold a candle against the real truth: we’re all people and we’re all in this together.
