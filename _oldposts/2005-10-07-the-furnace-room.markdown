> “Knock on the sky and listen to the sound.” — Zen koan

When we arrived at "Deer Park":http://www.deerparkmonastery.org/, the furnace of late-summer heat was still in the “off” position, and a surprisingly cool, early-morning air greeted me as I nudged open the car door. Stepping out, I could physically feel the peace. I breathed deeply, soaking it in. The whimsical signs on the driveway leading up to Deer Park aptly described the feeling, reading in a scrawling cursive script: “You have arrived.”

And there I was. Deer Park is a Vietnamese Zen monastery, a dharma center founded under the tutelage of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Zen monk and pacifist during the Vietnam War who was once nominated by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. for the Nobel Peace Prize. Hidden in the foothills of Escondido, a San Diego suburb, you would never find this jewel of a place unless you specifically sought it. And even if you did find it accidentally, it’s quite possible you wouldn’t know what it was anyway. At first glance the place doesn’t look like much, a smattering of non-descript buildings here and there, housing for monks, nuns and guests. All very humble, and very much what one might expect of a Zen monastery, until you reach the top of the neighboring hill. Sitting on the crest of the hill, there it stood shining in the morning sun: the meditation hall, or zendo, a massive almost Spanish-mission style building surrounded in full-length windows. Clean and airy and open and, well, modern even.

We were late. The meditation session had already begun a few minutes prior. Hushed, confused and unversed in monastery etiquette, we entered anyway, clumsily searching for a meditation cushion, or zafu, and dropping in. I didn’t want to disturb the serenity of the moment, but we didn’t know what else to do. Later, a fellow visitor came up and said, “Don’t worry, even if the monks don’t like something, they’ll never tell you.” Funny, I thought Zen was about transcending “like” and “dislike” and moving into acceptance of “what is.” I guess if you can’t do that, you might as well pretend by keeping your mouth shut!


Entering the zendo, at first I looked around — wide-eyed like an out-of-place visitor in a foreign land. The monks and nuns sat up front, lining the aisle in rows of brown and saffron robes topped with bald heads. Women sat on one side, men on the other. Not realizing this at first, I initially tried to sit with the women before a fellow meditator quickly illuminated the error in my lack of attention. To be honest, though, it’s difficult to tell who’s male and who’s female when everyone’s sporting the Mr. Clean look.

Fortunately, the initial clumsiness was met without judgment. Such is their way. And after a little more shuffling, all was well. Finally settled, and already experienced in meditation, I allowed myself to be absorbed in the silence in the room. Initially, I just sat there to sit there — allowing the thoughts to come and go, the subtle sounds of breathing and the chirping of the birds outside to rise and fall in my ears. I didn’t try to do anything because I didn’t know exactly what to do. It was a multi-cultural experiment of sorts.

When eventually the time came for chanting and prostrations, I did what anyone would do such a situation: I copied everybody else. This was a game of monk see, monk do, and besides, the chants were in Vietnamese. Bell rings once, go down. Bell rings once again followed by a second, quick ring, stand up. I didn’t have a clue what I was doing, but still I could feel the beauty and the flow of it all. I stopped thinking and just did it. Everything was taken in with beginner’s mind.

I let go. I let go of trying to pretend like I knew what I was doing. I let go of trying to be right, or perfect or experienced or not clumsy. I let go of the fear of all that was new and foreign. For just a moment I let go of the ego.

By the time we exited the hall, the summer heat was on full blast, the monks and nuns shielding themselves from the sun under the shade of those archetypal Vietnamese palm leaf hats (also known as a non bai tho). But inside it was just as hot, not through the work of the sun, but through the work of many souls seeking enlightenment. As Japanese Zen master Eido Roshi once said, “A zendo is not a peaceful haven, but a furnace room for the combustion of our delusions.” And a what beautiful furnace room it was. I can’t wait to go back.
