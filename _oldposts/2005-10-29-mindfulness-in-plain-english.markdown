title: Mindfulness in plain English
---

If there is one thing I can and do recommend to everyone whenever I get the opportunity to do so, it’s this: explore the benefits of a *regular* and *consistent* meditation practice. Not only is the resultant stress reduction conducive to good health, but more importantly, mindfulness and meditation are the only means I know to effectively explore, understand and know the self. Meditation is like putting your mind under a microscope. To your mind is to know your self, and to know the self is to let go of the self, become a better human being, and, as a result, improve your relationships.

Sometimes people object when I tell them that they should try meditation, claiming differences of ideology — that it’s not part of their religion. This is due to a common misunderstanding. **Meditation is not about belief or religion.** Again, it’s about knowing the self. You can do it as a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim, a Hindu, a Buddhist, an atheist, whatever. There are, of course, many forms of meditation that are specifically tied to various religious traditions (Eastern traditions in particular), but there are also many that are not. There are many that do not require any religiously specific mantras, visualizations, chanting, etc. One of these, the form I recommend for getting started, is known as vipassana meditation. Vipassana (a Pali word for “insight”) is the same type of meditation taught by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn at the renowned Stress Reduction Clinic at UMass.

Of all the books I’ve seen on vipassana meditation, [Mindfulness in Plain English](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=eatorange-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0861713214%2526tag=eatorange-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0861713214%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82) is one of the best, an excellent introduction and “how-to” for both the beginning or experienced meditator. I’ve found very few books that manage to skillfully explain mindfulness or meditation — not suprising considering that it transcends language and is thus difficult to explain in the first place — but this book manages to pull it off masterfully. From posture to breathing to concentration to pain, this book seems to answer just about every conceivable question or problem a beginner could encounter. It’s profound and precise, without philosophical confusion, focusing almost purely on the practice and psychology of meditation.

If you’re new to meditation, or are looking to get started, try [this book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=eatorange-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0861713214%2526tag=eatorange-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0861713214%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82). It’s an excellent guide to a life-long practice for wise and peaceful living.
