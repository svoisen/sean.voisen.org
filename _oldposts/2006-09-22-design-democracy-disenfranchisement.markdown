title: Design, democracy and disenfranchisement
---

Computer science researchers at Princeton University have posted a [fascinating and troubling](http://itpolicy.princeton.edu/voting/) video on the complete lack of security found in the Diebold AccuVote-TS voting machine — both in its hardware and software. The troubling part is how ridiculously easy it is to hack one of these machines in less than 60 seconds such that it can swing an entire election without a shred of evidence. Even more troubling is that, from what I’ve heard, these same machines will be used in all San Diego County precincts in the next election, and of course, in many other voting precincts throughout the country as well.

One of the few areas where design and technology make a big impact in the social sphere, but tend to get mostly (and unfortunately) neglected, is in the area of democracy — or more specifically, our system for voting. The many interface design flaws of the United States’ varied, state-by-state, voting system have already been more than well analyzed and documented, with [plenty of improvements proposed](http://www.designfordemocracy.org/).

But the UI design of ballots and voting systems is not the only problem. We have the additional problems of inaccuracy, insecurity, lack of uniform standards, difficulty and cost of tabulation, coupled with a growing lack of trust in the system as a whole. It’s absolutely appalling that the United States, a nation that is supposedly a proud exporter of this idea called “democracy,” can’t even rely and trust the most basic and fundamental system required to successfully carry out the export. It sends a bad message to the world.

Voting system design and reliability isn’t a partisan issue. Whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or a Libertarian, it doesn’t matter — it’s absolutely absurd that we should even have to recount votes or debate the various nuanced characteristics of a “hanging chad.” As a technologist, I’m optimistic that the United States is slowly moving into the 21st century with its voting technology, but it’s both disheartening and infuriating that we are going about it in such a sloppy manner. As Americans, we need to be able to have total trust in the voting system that serves as the very foundation of our government. And trust, in the world of design and technology, comes from complete and total *transparency*. Like all those folks from the great state of Missouri might say: “show me.”

That’s why I think open-source voting software and hardware might indeed be the only solution to problems like the Diebold AccuVote-TS. It’s transparent, it can be made far more secure, and it can be scrutinzed by thousands of eyeballs from all interested parties. And the geeks and politicians at the [Open Voting Consortium](http://www.openvotingconsortium.org/) are the only ones I know of who might be headed down this far more promising path to a secure, digital democracy.
