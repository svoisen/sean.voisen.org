    <p style="margin-top:0"><strong>Hi!</strong> My name is Sean. I make software that helps people express their creativity and share it with the world.</em> Currently, I work at <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Mozilla</a> engineering manager for the team responsible for layout in <a href="http://www.firefox.com">Firefox</a>. Previously, I spent a good chunk of time at <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a>, helping build design tools such as <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html">Adobe XD</a>. I have a B.S. in computer science from <a href="http://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a> and an M.S. in information and computer science from the Arts Computation Engineering program at <a href="http://www.uci.edu">UC Irvine</a>.</p>

    <p>My primary interests fall into the categories of computer graphics, user-interface design, human-computer interaction, functional programming, typography, and the new media arts.</p>

    <p>My technical experience is broad, but I tend to specialize in C/C++, Objective-C, and JavaScript/TypeScript.</p>

    <p>This site is a personal compendium of various projects and musings. Feel free to browse, marvel, scoff or enjoy!</p>
