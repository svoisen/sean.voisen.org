<p style="margin-top: 0"><strong>Hello!</strong> I'm Sean. I'm a software engineer with an interest in making computing more humane, convivial, and creative.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm helping build new web-based creative tools at <a href="https://adobe.com">Adobe</a>. In the past, I managed engineering teams working on Firefox at <a href="https://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, built web-based tools for making animated comics at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/madefire-shuts-down/">Madefire</a>, and led prototype engineering in Adobe's <a href="https://adobe.design">Design Studio</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m originally from California, and live with my wife and kids in the San Francisco Bay area. I have a B.S. in computer science from UCLA and an M.S. in information and computer science from the Arts Computation Engineering program at UC Irvine.</p>

<p>This site is a compendium of various projects and musings. I tend to write primarily about topics related to human-computer interaction, cognitive science, ethics, and software engineering leadership. If anything I write resonates with you, please feel free to send me a note.</p>
