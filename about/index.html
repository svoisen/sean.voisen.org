<p><strong>Hello!</strong> My name is Sean. I make software that helps people <em>learn</em>, <em>create</em> and <em>play.</em> Currently, I work as an Experience Design Developer at <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a> XD. I have a B.S. in computer science from <a href="http://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a> and an M.S. in information and computer science from the <a href="http://ace.uci.edu">Arts Computation Engineering</a> program at <a href="http://www.uci.edu">UC Irvine</a>.</p>

<p>My primary interests fall into the categories of educational technology, ludic design, ubiquitous computing, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence and the new media arts.</p>

<p>This site is a personal compendium of various projects and musings. Feel free to browse, marvel, scoff or enjoy!</p>
