    <p style="margin-top:0"><strong>Hi!</strong> My name is Sean. I make software that helps people <em>express</em> and <em>share</em> their creativity.</em> Currently, I work as a Sr. Computer Scientist at <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a>, helping to build <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/experience-design.html">Adobe XD</a>. I have a B.S. in computer science from <a href="http://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a> and an M.S. in information and computer science from the Arts Computation Engineering program at <a href="http://www.uci.edu">UC Irvine</a>.</p>

    <p>My primary interests fall into the categories of computer graphics, data visualization, multitouch and embodied interaction, typography, computational linguistics, and the new media arts.</p>

    <p>My technical experience is broad, but I tend to specialize in Objective-C, C/C++, JavaScript, and C for Arduino and AVR microcontrollers.</p>

    <p>This site is a personal compendium of various projects and musings. Feel free to browse, marvel, scoff or enjoy!</p>
