    <p style="margin-top:0"><strong>Hi!</strong> My name is Sean. I make software that helps people <em>express</em> their creativity and <em>share</em> it with the world.</em> Currently, I work as Director of Creative Tools at <a href="http://www.madefire.com">Madefire</a>. Previously, I worked at <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a>, helping build design tools such as <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html">Adobe XD</a>. I have a B.S. in computer science from <a href="http://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a> and an M.S. in information and computer science from the Arts Computation Engineering program at <a href="http://www.uci.edu">UC Irvine</a>.</p>

    <p>My primary interests fall into the categories of computer graphics, user-interface design, human-computer interaction, functional programming, typography, and the new media arts.</p>

    <p>My technical experience is broad, but I tend to specialize in Objective-C, C/C++, and JavaScript/TypeScript.</p>

    <p>This site is a personal compendium of various projects and musings. Feel free to browse, marvel, scoff or enjoy!</p>

    <p>Or, <a href="/now">read more</a> about what Iâ€™m doing now</a>.</p>
