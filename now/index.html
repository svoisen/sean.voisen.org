  <div class="post">
      <p>Hello, and welcome to my <a href="https://sivers.org/now">now page</a>. Currently, I'm in Berkeley, California, focusing on the following:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Working at <a href="http://www.madefire.com">Madefire</a>, heads-down trying to get a re-designed version of our Motion Book Tool into the hands of visual storytellers everywhere.</li>
      <li>Being a (hopefully) mindful and attentive husband, as well as a mindful and attentive dad to a very active almost-toddler.</li>
      <li>Writing about software design, software engineering, and the interplay of software and creative expression.</li>
      <li>Simplifying my life by trying to get my number of personal possessions (including clothing items, shoes, sporting goods, books and other personal effects), down to or under 100.</li>
      <li>Hiking, meditating, and reading widely whenever possible.</li>
      </ul>
