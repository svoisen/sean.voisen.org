  <div class="post">
      <p>Hello, and welcome to my <a href="https://sivers.org/now">now page</a>. Currently, I'm in Berkeley, California, focusing on the following:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Working at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, managing the layout team for Firefox, and exploring management practices that make sense for such a highly-distributed team.</li>
      <li>Being a (hopefully) mindful and attentive husband, as well as a mindful and attentive dad to a very active toddler.</li>
      <li>Writing about software design, software engineering, and the interplay of software and creative expression.</li>
      <li>Simplifying my life by trying to get my number of personal possessions (including clothing items, shoes, sporting goods, books and other personal effects), down to or under 200. (Not going well.)</li>
      <li>Hiking, meditating, and reading widely whenever possible.</li>
      </ul>
