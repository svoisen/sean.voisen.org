title: A Fickle Heart
---

A fickle heart is a careless heart,  
and sometimes it's too easy to be fickle.  

I think often about the tide in Trinidad Bay,  
that Saturday I walked alone around the head,  
just me and my pain and the banana slugs.  
The sea beating on the jagged rocks,   
the sand swaying to and fro,   
the fog horn keeping time.  

The tide advancing and retreating,  
a slave to the whims of the moon,  
unable to decide on place or level.  

Is it the sea that is fickle, or is it she?  
Certainly they are lovers, the sea and the moon,  
dancing that slow lunar tango.  
Drawing and releasing,  
never too close,  
never too far apart.  

But the moon once had another lover, you know.  
Before the sea.  
First Terra, then Theia, destruction, accretion, re-birth.  
Now secure in a lonely, quiet orbit.  

But security is no excuse for happiness.  
And I cannot be the moon forever.
