title: Temptation
---

The shifting mocha curves of a young Venezuelan woman.  
Belied by the gentle folds of clean white sheets  
and a San Francisco breeze.  

The temptation of the malleable  
is to shed identity in search of a core  
which does not exist.  

Like groping a beautiful foreigner  
under the pretense of the acceptance  
that life has no meaning.  

Action. Observation. Hesitation. Inhalation.  
The dissonance between lustful imagination  
and the obstacles of reality.  
The gut is wiser than the heart,  
but less courageous.
