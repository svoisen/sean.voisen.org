The forest emanates a holy silence.  
Thin wisps of pallid fog meander through a swaying canopy,  
wetting salamanders, feeding ferns,  
placating giants with the riches of a tumultuous sea.  

He lives here for her, amidst the pillars and the quiet.  
Where the sun is an infrequent visitor and  
the rain a long unwelcome houseguest.  
But maybe not she for him, amidst the Yurok and the Kuruk and  
the Hupa and the Wiyot. Dancing, singing, sweating, living.  
A secret world within a secret world, enshrouded by  
Redwood curtains.  

They walk hand in hand for a while. Then separately. Then apart.  
She always slow, silent, in a kind of retreat.  
He meandering and rambling, searching for reprieve from  
the lonely oppressiveness of life outside her life.  

Perhaps it was inevitable. Where the tree puts down  
roots and remains a fixture for a thousand years, the  
fog simply â€¦ dissipates.
