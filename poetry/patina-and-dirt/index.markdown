title: Patina and Dirt
---

They said we were perfect for each other. But  
what is perfection but a kind of process? Like  
the breaking in of a new shoe, at first crisp  
and shiny and beautiful and untarnished. Then worn  
and worn and worn and worn until the leather  
bends and the scuffs become scars and the stories  
accumulate as patina and dirt.  

Is this perfection? In patina and dirt and  
the familiarity of unique routine? Old jokes  
repeated? Old haunts revisited? Slow walks through  
the woods on a rainy day with the creek overflowing  
and the squeaky swingset beckoning our laughter?  

When the shoe fit poorly we kissed and made love and  
danced an awkward summer salsa. When the shoe fit well   
we sat by the fire, sipping tea, retiring to bed young in  
a cool winter's evening.  

Until the sirens of novelty sang their sweet song, and  
she succumbed. Lackluster traded for luster.   
Perfection lost, perfection gained. And the Sysyphean  
process began anew.
