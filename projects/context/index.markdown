Project Context’s goal is to make in-person collaboration and content reviews more effective via instant natural file sharing, direct access to content repositories and seamless integration across multiple larger and mobile connected screens.

As team lead of engineering on the project, I was (and am) responsible for developing and maintaining the proprietary touch library, multitouch gesture recognizers, and architecture for much of Context, all written in Objective-C.
