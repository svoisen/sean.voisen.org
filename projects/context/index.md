title: Adobe Project Context
---

Project Context’s original goal was to make in-person collaboration and content reviews more effective via instant natural file sharing, direct access to content repositories and seamless integration across multiple larger and mobile connected screens.

As team lead of engineering on the project, I was responsible for developing and maintaining the proprietary touch library, multitouch gesture recognizers, and architecture for much of Context, originally all written in Objective-C. The project was later ported to JavaScript using Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF).
