The following is a series of sketches/experiments using [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL). To view them, you will require a modern browser that supports WebGL, as well as a computer with decent 3D graphics support. 

Content is continually curated, and will grow and change as time and energy permits.
