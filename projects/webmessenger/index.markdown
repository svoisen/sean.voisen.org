I spent two years as a contractor at Userplane (a subsidiary of AOL) working on Webmessenger, an instant messaging and chat system built using Adobe Flash, Flex and Flash Media Server. The system was later transitioned to use AOL's proprietary messaging protocol.

Most work involved architecture and development of the client software, though I did occasionally add features to the server as necessary.
