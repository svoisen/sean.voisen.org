title: Digital Seed
---

[Digital Seed](http://www.digital-seed.com) was a hybrid e-learning system that combined online learning experiences with offline, face-to-face group collaboration and sharing. The system began from my father's need &mdash; working as a management consultant &mdash; to better facilitate leadership training, personal growth programs and team building exercises for disparate teams in large organizations. As an alpha-version working prototype, Digital Seed piqued the interest of a variety of potential customers, but failing to gain necessary funding, continues to remain just that: a prototype.

The conceptualization, information architecture, and front-end programming for Digital Seed was primarily undertaken by me. [Dolores Joya](http://www.doloresjoya.com) provided much of the visual design, while [Daniel Wanja](http://www.n-so.com) and Lee Marlow assisted with Ruby on Rails development and deployment.
