title: Bluenumi Clock
---

Bluenumi began with the idea of creating an easy to assemble open-source kit clock that had nixie tube aesthetics, but without the associated cost or *potentially* dangerous high voltage. The result is a small, functional, and beautiful desktop clock featuring 100% through-hole electronic components that looks like a nixie clock, but can be built at a fraction of the price.

The Bluenumi is available [for sale as a kit or in limited quantity pre-assembled on Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/shop/VoisenDesign).

### Features

* “Retro” incandescent glowing display, featuring Russian IV-9 numitron tubes

* Programmable alarm
* 12- or 24-hour operating mode with AM/PM indicator light
* Easy display blanking for nighttime use and tube life preservation
