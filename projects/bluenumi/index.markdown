title: Bluenumi Clock
---

Bluenumi began with the idea of creating an easy to assemble open-source kit clock that had nixie tube aesthetics, but without the associated cost or potentially dangerous high voltage. The result is a small, functional, and beautiful desktop clock featuring 100% through-hole electronic components that looks like a nixie clock, but can be built at a fraction of the price.

The Bluenumi will be available for sale as a kit, as well as in limited pre-assembled batches, in early February 2012.
