title: Adobe Digital Publishing Suite
---

Of all the projects I've worked on at Adobe Systems, perhaps the most visible (and the only one presently sharable) is the Adobe&reg; Digital Publishing Suite. 

During my first year at Adobe I worked on HTML support within the magazine viewer software, both for long-form article stacks and HTML object overlays. I also worked on the HTML pagination demos delivered during the keynote at Adobe MAX 2010, when the Digital Publishing Suite was formally launched to the general public.
