title: Losing my (digital) toolbox
---

Would it be cliche to say that you don’t know the value of something until it’s gone? Well, allow me to go ahead and say it anyway.

The DC-in board on my MacBook Pro died today. I had to take the machine to the local Apple Store — my first time at the so-called “Genius Bar” — to see about getting it repaired. Now, I’m going to be without my computer for possibly the next week or so. I’ve been using Apple computers since 2001, and this is the first time I’ve had this kind of debilitating hardware failure on any of the Apple products I’ve owned. (I use the word “debilitating” because, hey, without electrical power a MacBook is nothing more than an expensive paper weight. And a paper weight doesn’t help me get my work done.)

As a programmer and designer, I’m pretty much adrift in an ocean of time without a paddle if I don’t have my computer. I’m like a carpenter without any tools. I’m like a musician without an instrument. In other words, when it comes to my work, I’m kind of useless.

And while I make regular backups of my data, it never occurred to me until today that I should also make sure I have backup hardware to go with it. Imagine that! I managed to get a hold of an old IBM Thinkpad, but of course none of the software I need is installed on the machine, none of the settings are anywhere near correct, and most importantly, none of the development environments I need to do my work have been set up on this machine — no Ruby, no Rails, no Subversion, no CVS, no Eclipse or FlexBuilder, no Flash … nothing. Oy vey. Happy Halloween!
