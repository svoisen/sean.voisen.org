title: Peel away the layers

> To study the Way (of design) is to study the self.

> To be enlightened by all things is to remove the barriers between one’s self and others. — Dogen Zenji Dai Osho

I can think of nothing more imperative to do than to study the self — to question, ponder and pontificate on every belief, idea and paradigm you have about this thing you call “me.” What is it really? Peel away the layers and see what you might find, not only the layers that are of your own creation — the layers of your life experiences — but also the layers that you adapted from previously devised cultural philosophies. Who am I? And who is the I that is asking “Who am I?” Most of us are either naturally born or culturally influenced dualists, following some (possibly false) intuitive sense that our mind and soul — the core, authentic me — is separate from our body. “Cogito ergo sum,” Descartes said. But what does that mean? Are we really just homunculi driving around in some machine made of meat? I don’t buy it.
