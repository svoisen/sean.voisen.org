One of the great many benefits to teaching computer programming, hands-on, with art students, in a computer lab, is that I’ve become extraordinarily adept at finding the subtlest of syntax errors with little more than a two-second glance. (Well, this may be a slight exaggeration, but nevertheless, it’s fairly close.) Semicolon? No, no, no … that should be a regular colon. You need an uppercase L on line 63; remember that the language we are programming in is case seNsITive. You’re missing an import statement for the MouseEvent class.

Perhaps one day I will be able to hire out my services as a human lexicographical analyzer and parser. I’ll just stare at a computer screen and read code from 9 to 5. It’s not too different from what I do already, and the beautiful thing about syntax errors is that they’re easy to fix once spotted. I am going to have to boost up everyone’s font size though; my optometrist doesn’t want me squinting anymore.
