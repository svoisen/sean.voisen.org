Sometimes, in the process of building and creation, you’re told that you should never try to “reinvent the wheel.” If it’s out there already, take it and use it.

Unless you’re trying to learn something. Then I say take the wheel, study it backwards and forwards, and reinvent it a hundred times over. Practice building wheels over and over again. You may just learn how to build a better wheel in the process.

When you’re learning how to program something, copy and paste is your enemy, not your friend. Type out every character in your own unique way.
