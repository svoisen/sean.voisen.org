title: Social networking and ad-hoc teams
---

If online social networking is such a big thing right now, and free agent workers are the biggest users and builders of loosely tied social networks, why are there no social networking sites specifically targeting this niche? Why isn’t there a specific feature in [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) that would allow me to leverage my existing network to build an ad hoc team for a new client? If I need an interaction designer and a Ruby programming expert, why can’t people in my network tag themselves as such so that I can quickly find the people I need to contact? Why can’t a given group of people be tied together as a team that worked on a specific project? And why is the “job” feature so geared towards full-time jobs and not one-off projects or “gigs?”

37Signals just launched their [gig board](http://gigs.37signals.com/). That’s great and all, but in the context of a free agent “gig,” wouldn’t you rather work with someone you’ve either successfully worked with before, or someone who comes recommended through an acquaintence or friend, than a random applicant from the Internet? I know I would. The gig board and LinkedIn need to be merged somehow, with a user experience that directly targets the problems I’m talking about — something that lets you visualize and leverage the loose ties of the free agent ecosystem.
