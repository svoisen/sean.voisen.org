title: Too overwhelmed to care
---

In a comment on a my previous post about 50 Facts that Should Change the World, [Andrew](http://www.andrewphelps.com/) duly pointed out the problem with publicizing ever more facts about global atrocities and injustices as a means of fighting apathy:

> There are so many problems in the world and, thus, so many social causes. In the olden days, before the information revolution of the late 20th century, we weren’t as aware of them. Now we are overloaded. We are desensitized. Banner ads, infomercials, newspaper photos … I can’t even process it anymore.

I was reminded of an anecdote that Thomas de Zengotita recounted in his book [Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=eatorange-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=1582343578%2526tag=eatorange-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/1582343578%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82) and the Way You Live in It. In it he describes leaders of a certain university’s Latino activist group lamenting over the “paltry” turnout for a club event featuring a prominent speaker (a former follower of Cesar Chavez). On hearing this, an older woman, an outspoken activist in her day, spoke up, crying out, “I can’t believe that in a school like this there aren’t opportunities for *all* of our students to bring their issues to the community …” One of the students responded, “No, no, that’s no the problem. The problem is that there are too *many* opportunities.”

De Zengotita goes on to comment that the social causes of the relatively uninundated 60s generation had become, for Generation Y, “inundated with exhortations to care about one thing or another since their Sesame Street days,” nothing more than a “battery of demands they couldn’t possibly meet. Hence, so-called apathy among the many in the 1980s and 1990s …”

Later he further elaborates on the problems inherent in a media-saturated culture such as ours. Today, even the issues we choose to take a stand on stem from our need to further decorate and solidify our own sense of identity. It’s ego run rampant.

> Today’s issues are iconic. That means, above all, that they have no comprehensive basis, no foundation in principles rooted in serious thought about the human condition as opposed to blind dogma and one’s sense of self. Take a position on an iconic issue — immigration, abortion, gay marriage, minimum wage, whatever — and what are you doing? Expressing your identity and promoting the interests of the group you identify with — and so on, down the list of issues, the items bundled in accordance with the needs and tastes of whoever does the choosing.

Our insatiable appetite for information and media has resulted in as many problems as benefits. Overwhelmed and desensitized, we, especially my generation, have become paralyzed at a fork in the road that splits in infinitely many ways. But what’s worse is the reinforcing reflective nature of it all — everything geared towards putting us, the viewers at the center of the world, building our egos and separating instead of unifying. Nobody wants to feel “ordinary” anymore. Nobody wants to feel not unique, not more important than they are. De Zengotita uses voting as an example:

> Not voting is refusing to play a particular role in the political scenario because that role is so insignificant, not without aggregate consequences but without public meaning in the anonymity of the deed. Alone in the booth you pull the lever, press the button — who cares? This is not what the flattered self has come to expect.

We need to spend some time in silence, away from the overload, consciously dismantling the “flattered self” piece by piece. I know of no other way.
