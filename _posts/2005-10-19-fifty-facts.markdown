A few facts from Jessica Williams’ [50 Facts that Should Change the World](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=eatorange-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0972952969%2526tag=eatorange-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0972952969%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82):

* Americans discard 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour. That’s enough bottles to reach all the way to the moon every three weeks.
* Every cow in the European Union is subsidized by $2.50 a day. That’s more than what 75 per cent of Africans have to live on. Every cow in Japan is subsidized $7.50 a day.
* More than 70% of the world’s population have never heard a dial tone.
* There are about 6000 living languages in the world. 10 languages die out every year.
* China has 44 million missing women.
* More people can identify the golden arches of McDonalds than the Christian cross.

Obviously, these are just a few facts that should change the world, but of course this will never happen because of facts alone. Facts, it seems, no matter how dire or appalling, are no cure for apathy, greed or lack of coordinated effort. All 50 facts can be found [here](http://nipun.charityfocus.org/blog/ar/books/000929.html).
