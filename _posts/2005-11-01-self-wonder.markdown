title: Self wonder

Though I may not see it with the same Augustinian eye, I still love it nonetheless:

> People travel to wonder at the height of the mountains, at the huge waves of the sea, at the long course of rivers, at the vast compass of the ocean, at the circular motion of the stars; and they pass by themselves without wondering. â€” St. Augustine
