We often take for granted that most writers in the modern era perform their work on computers. For the vast majority of writers, amateur and professional alike, the physical act of writing is synonymous with the physical act of typing. Still, there are a small number of writers out there who shun keyboards of any kind, preferring the simpler, time-honored, analog implements of paper and pen. Pulitzer Prize-winninng poet [Mary Oliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Oliver) (1935-2019), for instance, famously disliked working indoors, preferring to write most of her poetry during long walks through the fields and woods. [Neil Gaiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman) has been known to use a fountain pen when working on early drafts of new stories. And farmer, poet, activist, novelist and essayist [Wendell Berry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_Berry), similarly eschews computers and typewriters in favor of paper and pencil. 

In his essay, [Why I Am Not Going to Buy a Computer](https://bookshop.org/p/books/why-i-am-not-going-to-buy-a-computer-essays-wendell-berry/14393101), Berry cites both environmental and ethical reasons why he chooses to work with analog tools instead of a computer, enumerating his personal standards for adopting new tools in his work. These include: "The new tool should be cheaper than the one it replaces." "It should use less energy than the one it replaces." And, "It should not replace or disrupt anything good that already exists, and this includes family and community relationships." He adds:

> ... when somebody has used a computer to write work that is demonstrably better than Dante's, and when this better is demonstrably attributable to the use of a computer, then I will speak of computers with a more respectful tone of voice, though I still will not buy one.

Certainly, no computer is going to help anyone write better than Dante. That said, Berry wrote his essay in 1989, long before the advent of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, when speed and ease of editing were only primary advantages computers provided writers over analog tools. It is interesting to revisit these criteria at a moment when computers can now even *write for you* but at even great monetary and environmental cost.

While Berry's reasons for resisting digital technology are worth pondering, his reasons for *embracing* handwriting in his follow-up essay, [Feminism, the Body, and the Machine](), strike at the real heart of the issue, and offer a deep reflection on the value of writing as an embodied act. Beginning with the argument that much technological development aims to squarely "solve" the issue of human embodiment, Berry writes:

> The danger most immediately to be feared in "technological progress" is the degradation and obsolescence of the body. Implicit in the technological revolution from the beginning has been a new version of an old dualism, one always destructive, and now more destructive than ever.

>A handwritten or typewritten page therefore is usually to some degree a palimpsest; it contains parts and relics of its own history—erasures, passages crossed out, interlineations—suggesting that there is something to go back to as well as something to go forward to. The light-text on the computer screen, by contrast, is an artifact typical of what can only be called the industrial present, a present absolute. A computer destroys the sense of historical succession, just as do other forms of mechanization. . . . look at a large factory or a power plant or an airport, and see if you can imagine—even if you know—what was there before. In such things materials of the world have entered a kind of orphanhood.
