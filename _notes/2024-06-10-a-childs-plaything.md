Read [A Child's Plaything](https://www.tobyord.com/writing/a-childs-plaything)
by Toby Ord. Such a brilliant short story that says so much about modern life
with so little.

>And they would understand that the people of our time are so wealthy, so

I immediately think of software (because that's always where my mind goes),
where amazing capabilities have become rapidly commoditized, but where high
levels of quality and craft remain scarce. With templates and boilerplate and
starter packs and generative AI we can more easily spin-up complicated working
systems than ever before—including tools with an astonishing simulacrum of
intelligence—but to build something of beauty still requires ingredients that
remain in short supply: time, attention, and care.
