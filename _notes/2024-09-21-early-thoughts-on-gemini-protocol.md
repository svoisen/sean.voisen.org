[Gemini](https://geminiprotocol.net/) has been around for a few years now, so I’m very late to the scene. But, having discovered it during my reading on [permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/) as a low-resource, low-power “smol web” option, I thought I’d try it out for a few days. Some initial impressions:

- I enjoy the tight limitations of the format.
- Content discovery is challenging, but there are [some decent search engines](gemini://kennedy.gemi.dev/) at least. Once you find a good community-oriented capsule, like the [Geminispace BBS](gemini://bbs.geminispace.org/) or [Flounder](gemini://flounder.online), it’s fun to dig around and read various blogs (they call them “gemlogs”), which will occasionally link to other interesting resources.
- There are plenty of broken links and capsules that are no longer updated or receiving any attention. Clearly, lots of people tried Gemini a couple years ago and then abandoned.
