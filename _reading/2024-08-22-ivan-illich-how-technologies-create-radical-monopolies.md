From restaurants foisting QR codes for access to menus on patrons, to digital boarding passes, to museum and concert tickets requiring bespoke apps, smartphone ownership is now often a deciding factor for access to cultural opportunities, or at the very least, a differentiator in the level of service one may receive in a greater multitude of commercial interactions. What's worse, owning just *any* smartphone is often insufficient in these situations, one must own a smartphone tied to one of only two major application ecosystems: Apple's or Google's.

In 1973, cultural critic [Ivan Illich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Illich) (1926-2002) warned us about this phenomenon in [Tools for Conviviality](), calling the exclusive control a technology can exert over aspects of daily living a "radical monopoly." He wrote:

> Generally we mean by "monopoly" the exclusive control by one corporation over the means of producing (or selling) a commodity or service ... By "radical monopoly" I mean the dominance of one type of product rather than the dominance of one brand. I speak about radical monopoly when one industrial production process exercises an exclusive control over the satisfaction of a pressing need, and excludes nonindustrial activities from competition.

Smartphones did not exist in 1973 of course. But Illich gives us an example of another familiar technology that now exerts a radical monopoly over daily life: the automobile. Over mere decades, the proliferation of the automobile radically altered the infrastructure of cities so that they were designed to best accommodate this single mode of transportation, often to the exclusion or detriment of walking, bicycling, or public transportation. Especially in the US during the middle and latter half of the 20th century, cities were developed with ever-wider roads, longer blocks, limited or non-existent sidewalks, encircling superhighways, and vast sprawl that was impossible or extremely inconvenient to traverse without access to a car. Wrote Illich:

> Cars can thus monopolize traffic. They can shape a city into their image—practically ruling out locomotion on foot or by bicycle in Los Angeles ... Of course they are dangerous and costly. But the radical monopoly cars establish is destructive in a special way. Cars create distance. Speedy vehicles of all kinds render space scarce. They drive wedges of highways into populated areas, and then extort tolls on the bride over the remoteness between people that was manufactured for their sake. This monopoly over land turns space into car fodder. It destroys the environment for feet and bicycles.

Physical infrastructure like that required for transportation possesses a high degree of inertia—it is very difficult and costly to undo—often creating a flywheel effect of increased dependency and further development of the same kind of infrastructure. The result is a kind of technological lock-in to a single way of being. As Illich wrote:

> Monopoly is hard to get rid of when it has frozen not only the shape of the physical world but also the range of behavior and imagination. Radical monopoly is generally discovered when it is too late.

Moving beyond transportation, Illich argued that radical monopolies have also developed in other industries and sectors, including education, healthcare, and even the burying of the dead. His examples and arguments against radical monopoly compose but a small part of his much broader argument against industrial productivity in favor of what he called "conviviality," a way of being in the world emphasizing personal autonomy, interdependence between individuals, and freedom from imposed dependence on industrially-produced goods or services. A society is convivial, argued Illich, if people have the freedom to jointly shape and create things in mutual interdependence with each other and with nature. Or, in Illich's own words:

> I choose the term "conviviality" to designate the opposite of industrial productivity. I intend it mean autonomous and create intercourse among persons, and the intercourse of persons with their environment; and contrast this with the conditioned response of persons to demands made upon them by others, and by a man-made environment ... A convivial society should be designed to allow all its members the most autonomous action by means of tools least controlled by others.

The radical monopoly of any technology is thus anti-convivial because it restricts personal autonomy and increases dependence on the few producers of that technology and associated infrastructure. Cars create car infrastructure and thus car dependence, exacerbating class stratification between car owners and those who do not own cars. Education, argued Illich, operates similarly because the requirement of a four-year degree increasingly differentiates

We now see something similar happening with smartphones.
